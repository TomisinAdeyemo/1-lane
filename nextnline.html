            <h1>NEXT-N-LINE: THE MOUNTAINEER OF AFROBEATS</h1>
            <p class="p-main"><span style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif; font-weight: 700; font-size:large">By The Motherland Magazine</span><br>
                In the ever-evolving landscape of African music, only a rare few ascend with authenticity, grit, and soul. 
                WAHAB born Wahab Sule isn’t just another name in the mix. He’s a mountaineer in the genre, scaling the uncharted 
                peaks of Afrobeat with the spirit of a pioneer and the heart of a storyteller.
             </p>

             <p class="p-main">From choir benches in Edo State to the shimmering studio lights of Lagos, Wahab’s journey 
                began with a spark—literally. His debut single in 2020 lit a fire that’s only grown brighter. Today, with over 
                52,000 monthly impressions and a rising fanbase across Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, Wahab isn’t just 
                making music, he’s leading a movement. A movement grounded in his roots and elevated by his unmistakable voice.

             </p>

             <p class="p-main">Much like a mountaineer navigating treacherous ridges with meticulous intent, Wahab crafts every 
                melody and lyric with precision. His breakout track “Appreciate You” may have started from a spontaneous 
                studio session, but its resonance was anything but accidental. It was the result of relentless dedication, honed 
                from years of finding his voice in the choir and transforming it into a global instrument of feeling.

             </p>

             <p class="p-main">Wahab’s art is more than rhythm, it’s a climb. Each beat is a foothold. Each verse, a grip on 
                the listener’s soul. Whether traversing the rocky edges of heartbreak, the steep slopes of passion, or the mountaintop 
                of joy, Wahab does it with the finesse of a seasoned alpinist. His storytelling doesn’t just entertain, it transcends.

             </p>

             <p class="p-main">WAHAB isn’t just next in line. He’s already halfway up the summit, golden 
                Timberlands on his feet, mic in hand, roaring from the clouds. Watch this space. Wahab is climbing and he’s taking the Motherland with him.
             </p>

             <p class="p-main">

                <br><span span style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif; font-weight: 700; font-size:large">WAHAB:</span> Yes, it was. I felt it was time to show this part of me. It was necessary.
