            <h1>MANCHESTER UNITED AMONG TOP CLUBS EYEING ADEMOLA LOOKMAN
            </h1>
            <p class="p-main">
                Ademola Lookman’s standout form for Atalanta has placed him firmly on the radar of Europe’s elite, with Manchester 
                United reportedly among several clubs preparing a summer swoop for the Nigerian forward.
             </p>

             <p class="p-main">Sources suggest that United, alongside Arsenal, Newcastle, PSG, and Barcelona, are keeping close tabs 
                on the 27-year-old after his stellar 2024/25 campaign. Lookman played a crucial role in Atalanta’s impressive season, netting 
                15 goals and registering five assists in 31 Serie A appearances. He also etched his name into European football history last year 
                with a Europa League final hat-trick against Bayer Leverkusen.

             </p>

             <p class="p-main">Atalanta have set a valuation of £50 million (€60 million) for the in-form attacker, who is believed 
                to be open to a new challenge. While the Italian club are in no rush to sell, they’re prepared to consider offers that meet their asking price.

             </p>

             <p class="p-main">Manchester United are expected to bolster their attack this summer under Ruben Amorim, with a 
                focus on adding both a central striker and a dynamic playmaker. Lookman fits the profile, offering versatility, 
                creativity, and a proven goal threat.

             </p>

             <p class="p-main">Having previously featured in the Premier League with Everton, Lookman brings experience, hunger, and a point to prove, 
                all of which could make him one of the most talked-about names in this summer’s transfer window.

             <h1>ARSENAL TARGET GIBBS-WHITE TO BOLSTER MILDFIED FIREPOWER
            </h1>

            <div class="slideshow-box">
                <div class="slideshow-wrapper">
                  <img src="./ars1.jpeg" class="slide-img active" alt="Slide 1" />
                  <img src="./ars2.jpeg" class="slide-img" alt="Slide 2" />

                </div>
              </div>

            <p class="p-main">Arsenal are reportedly stepping up their pursuit of Nottingham Forest playmaker Morgan Gibbs-White as 
                Mikel Arteta looks to reinforce his midfield ahead of next season. With Champions League football on offer at 
                the Emirates, the 24-year-old is said to be open to the move, eyeing the next big step in his career.
             </p>

             <p class="p-main">Gibbs-White delivered a standout Premier League campaign, contributing 8 assists and 9 goals across 34 
                appearances. His creativity and energy have made him a key figure for Forest and a prime target for top clubs. Arsenal, 
                alongside Manchester City, are believed to be weighing up offers, with Forest reportedly valuing him at £100 million amid 
                concerns over PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) compliance.

             </p>

             <p class="p-main">Former Premier League scout Mick Brown has backed the move, describing Gibbs-White as the 
                “perfect answer” to complement Declan Rice in Arsenal’s midfield. His ability to create chances, dictate tempo, 
                and thrive in high-pressure moments aligns well with Arteta’s vision for a more dynamic and attacking midfield setup.


             </p>

             <p class="p-main">Gibbs-White has also been linked with a move to Manchester City as a possible 
                long-term replacement for Kevin De Bruyne, after the club pulled out of a potential deal for Florian Wirtz. 
                But with Arsenal showing serious intent, it could be a race between Premier League giants to secure his signature.

             </p>

             <p class="p-main">With 47 goal contributions in 154 top-flight games and an average match rating of 7.00 this season, Gibbs-White 
                is fast becoming one of the most sought-after midfielders in the league.
             </p>
