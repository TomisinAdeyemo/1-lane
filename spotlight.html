            <h1>NEXT-N-LINE: THE MOUNTAINEER OF AFROBEATS</h1>
            <p class="p-main">By The Motherland Magazine
                In the ever-evolving landscape of African music, only a rare few ascend with authenticity, grit, and soul. 
                WAHAB born Wahab Sule isn’t just another name in the mix. He’s a mountaineer in the genre, scaling the uncharted 
                peaks of Afrobeat with the spirit of a pioneer and the heart of a storyteller.
             </p>

             <p class="p-main">From choir benches in Edo State to the shimmering studio lights of Lagos, Wahab’s journey 
                began with a spark—literally. His debut single in 2020 lit a fire that’s only grown brighter. Today, with over 
                52,000 monthly impressions and a rising fanbase across Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, Wahab isn’t just 
                making music, he’s leading a movement. A movement grounded in his roots and elevated by his unmistakable voice.

             </p>

             <p class="p-main">Much like a mountaineer navigating treacherous ridges with meticulous intent, Wahab crafts every 
                melody and lyric with precision. His breakout track “Appreciate You” may have started from a spontaneous 
                studio session, but its resonance was anything but accidental. It was the result of relentless dedication, honed 
                from years of finding his voice in the choir and transforming it into a global instrument of feeling.

             </p>

             <p class="p-main">Wahab’s art is more than rhythm, it’s a climb. Each beat is a foothold. Each verse, a grip on 
                the listener’s soul. Whether traversing the rocky edges of heartbreak, the steep slopes of passion, or the mountaintop 
                of joy, Wahab does it with the finesse of a seasoned alpinist. His storytelling doesn’t just entertain, it transcends.

             </p>

             <p class="p-main">WAHAB isn’t just next in line. He’s already halfway up the summit, golden 
                Timberlands on his feet, mic in hand, roaring from the clouds. Watch this space. Wahab is climbing and he’s taking the Motherland with him.
             </p>

             <h1>NEXT-N-LINE: THE MOUNTAINEER OF AFROBEATS</h1>
             <p class="p-main">
                <span class="special-name2">The Motherland Magazine:</span> Wahab! Big congrats on the release of Emotions. How are you feeling right now?
                <br><span class="special-name">WAHAB</span> I feel so glad and excited to finally share this body of work with the world. It means a lot to me.

                <span class="special-name2">The Motherland Magazine:</span>The title says a lot. What inspired the name and theme of the EP?
                <br><span class="special-name">WAHAB</span> :Once all the tracks were complete, it was clear, there was no better title than Emotions. Every song came from a real place.

                <span class="special-name2">The Motherland Magazine:</span> Do you have a favorite track from the project?
                <br><span class="special-name">WAHAB</span> Honestly, I can’t choose just one. I have a deep connection with every track on the EP. They all represent different parts of me.

                <span class="special-name2">The Motherland Magazine:</span> You’ve always been rooted in Afrobeat, but this project reveals a softer, more introspective side. Was that intentional?
                <br><span class="special-name">WAHAB</span> Yes, it was. I felt it was time to show this part of me. It was necessary.

                <span class="special-name2">The Motherland Magazine:</span> What do you hope people feel when they listen to Emotions?
                <br><span class="special-name">WAHAB</span> I want people to feel true love, happiness, and a wave of real emotions. I want the music to heal and uplift.

                <span class="special-name2">The Motherland Magazine:</span> What’s next for Wahab?
                <br><span class="special-name">WAHAB</span> I’m going for everything big. My main plan is to keep growing and do better than I did before. That’s what I’m working on.

                <span> class="special-name2"The Motherland Magazine:</span> Final words for your fans?
                <br> <span class="special-name">WAHAB</span> Never give up. Keep pushing. It might not look like it today, but if you stay focused and know what you want, you’ll get there. Just keep your head up.
             </p>
